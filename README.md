# *tasty*lang

### A fun and *tasty* language for â„• representations and Turing complete programs using a stack based Î»-calculus with minimalist syntax.
### So much computation packed into such a tiny language! Oh my! âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

## Design Aspects
- Encode the **full range** of natural numbers without built in types
  - Construct numbers from scratch! ðŸ˜‹
- Use the expressiveness of the lambda calculus to encode large numbers computationally
  - Positional encodings can get so boring ðŸ˜©
- Use only the most minimal lexicon and syntax to enable Turing complete programs
  - Make it **pretty** ðŸ’…
- And above all.. make it ðŸŒˆ **fun** ðŸŒˆ
